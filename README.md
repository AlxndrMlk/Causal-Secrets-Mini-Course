## This Course in a Nutshell

**Causal Secrets Mini** is your introduction to causality with references to modern machine learning and experimentation.

In our journey, we'll view causality as a framework to explore whatâ€™s possible when we adopt an integrative perspective.


## What to Expect?

This course focuses on conceptual aspects of causality, rather than any particular software framework, although it comes with illustrative code examples in Python.

Causal Secrets Mini-Course is mostly a video-based course with additional rich text materials.

There's around 1h video material plus one extensive text lecture and a few shorter texts.


## Who is This Course For?

This course is for people interested in learning about or expanding their understanding of causality.

There are two main groups who will likely benefit most from this course:

- Data scientists, machine learning researchers and engineers, and statisticians who are just beginning their journey with causality
- People with some experience with causality who would like to expand their perspective and learn about causality as a framework, rather than a set of loosely connected methods and concepts

It's for data scientists in industry and academia, tech-savvy entrepreneurs and professionals working with data.


## Who is This Course Not For?

- If you expect a course that teaches step-by-step how to run causal analysis using a particular software framework, this is not that type of course. If you're looking for something like this, please share which frameworks you're interested in through the survey. We'll work on this type of course in the near future.
- If you consider yourself an expert in causal inference and causal machine learning, and especially if you're deeply familiar with the Pearlian perspective on causality, you might not benefit greatly from this course.
- If you strongly believe that we already solved all problems in artificial intelligence and achieved AGI, you probably will not benefit from this course.


## Prerequisites

Below are some prerequisites that will help you get the best out of this course. 

You can still take the course if you don't feel entirely confident in your skills and benefit from it.

- Good understanding of basic statistics (mean, linear regression, model fit statistics)
- Good understanding of machine learning basics (train/test split, model training)
- Basic knowledge of Python and its data ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, statsmodels); only required if you want to run or modify the code yourself
